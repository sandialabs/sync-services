* overall thoughts
- general purpose would be better...
  - implies that there is not a file-system.scm extension, right? right?
* conclusion
- question: should file system be a pure explorer?
  - i.e.: do we actually need a specialized interface for this?
  - pros:
    - single source of truth
  - cons:
    - performance for large files
      - but we mainly need this for other reasons
- the file-system thing is just a separate use case, not general-purpose explorer
- differences between FS and sync web data models
  - empty directories
  - most attributes will be undefined and chmod/chown not possible
    - could have a default file/directory and add optional (chmod/chown stuff)
      - maybe that could go in a mirrored *state* *fs* folder
  - lack of ability to build in more complex data
  - scalability (do I really want to save a pdf as bytes in rocksdb?)
    - why not?
  - is everything just a text file unless it's bytes?
* idea:
- need function to check expression (maybe at control level?)
* paths
** reading
- if symbol, then as-is
- if bytes, then interpret as hex
** writing
- only allow writing strings
  - if try to write hex, then escape somehow
- always create a new dummy file
* values
** reading
- if expression, then expression
- if string, then strip quotes
- if bytes, then parse and print
** writing
- if parses as expression, then do expression
- if ascii, then string
- if not ascii, then bytes
* dones
- figure out why there is such a long loop process start startup
* todos
- get chmod/chown/etc to work
- **really need to figure this out** get long documents to work
- handle refcount deletes
- have real directory attributes
