# Synchronic Web Services

This repository contains services and deployment configurations for the [Synchronic Web Journal](https://github.com/sandialabs/sync-journal) and [Synchronic Web Records](https://github.com/sandialabs/sync-records). It provides both ready-to-deploy, all-in-one Compose environments and individual microservice components that support Synchronic Web applications.

---

## Repository Structure

- **compose/**  
  Pre-packaged, batteries-included Docker Compose environments for deploying Synchronic Web journals and supporting services.  
  - Each subdirectory (e.g., `ledger/`, `ontology/`) contains everything needed to launch a complete application stack, including configuration, orchestration, and example scripts.
  - Ideal for users who want to quickly deploy a working Synchronic Web journal with minimal setup.

- **services/**  
  Standalone microservice components that provide additional functionality to composed deployments.  
  - These are not full applications by themselves, but are designed to be integrated into Compose environments or other orchestration systems.
  - Example: the `explorer` service provides a point-and-click front-end for exploring Synchronic Web record and ledger interfaces.

## Getting Started

To get started, choose a Compose environment that matches your use case:

- [compose/ledger/README.md](compose/ledger/README.md): Deploy a ledger journal for cryptographically verifiable record-keeping.
- [compose/ontology/README.md](compose/ontology/README.md): Deploy an ontology journal for semantic data and provenance workflows.

Each Compose README provides step-by-step instructions, required environment variables, and example usage. These environments are designed for rapid deployment and experimentationâ€”just follow the linked guides for details.

If you want to run or develop individual microservices, see the README in each service directory (e.g., [services/explorer/README.md](services/explorer/README.md)).
